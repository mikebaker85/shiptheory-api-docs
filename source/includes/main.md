# Introduction

Shiptheory provides a REST API that allows you to communicate directly with all of our [supported carriers](https://shiptheory.com/#integrations). Currently the following methods are available.

This documentation provides information on how to integrate with Shiptheory from other applications and covers creating and searching shipments, printing shipping labels and return labels as well as returning lists of available delivery services and package sizes.

## Testing with Postman and Insomnia

We recommend using a REST client during development. Two of our favourites are [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Partner Tag

If you are developing an application that will be used by more than 1 company, or an application that you intend to distribute in anyway, you must include the `Shiptheory-Partner-Tag` http request header in **all** of your requests.

```php
[
    'Accept: application/json',
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Content-Length: ' . strlen($data)),
    'Shiptheory-Partner-Tag: ExamplePartner1'
];
```

```javascript
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Shiptheory-Partner-Tag': 'ExamplePartner1'
  },
```

Please contact [partners@shiptheory.com](mailto:partners@shiptheory.com) to obtain a partner tag. Tags are used to provide better support to customers and partners.

If you are developing an integration with the Shiptheory API you will need to [register for a regular Shiptheory account](https://shiptheory.com/login). Once registered, please contact our [Partnerships Team](mailto:partners@shiptheory.com) who can set you up with Sandbox access.


## Pagination

Some API methods support pagination. A blue notice will show on the document for those that do. In the response data returned by methods that will support pagination, you will see pagination data as per the code panel to your right and described in the table below.

Field            | Description
---------------- | -------
page             | Current page number
pages            | Total number of pages with results
results          | Total results across all pages
results_per_page | Results per page
limit            | Limit of results to return

Methods that support pagination can be `sorted`, `limited` and `paged` by passing URL parameters.

For example: `https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/packages/sizes?sort=id&direction=desc&page=1&limit=10` will return page 1 of the first 10 package sizes sorted on the *id* with the biggest first. Each method has different sorting options and limitations, see the documentation on each method.

### Pagination Parameters

Parameter        | Description
---------------- | -------
sort             | Field to sort data by. See method documentation for supported fields
direction        | Ascending (asc) or Descending (desc)
page             | Page number to return. 404 means you have specified a page number without results
limit            | Limit of results to return

```json
{
  ...
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1, //current page
    "pages": 3, //total number of pages with results
    "results": 75, //total results across all pages
    "results_per_page": 25, //results per page
    "limit": 100 //limit
  }
}
```



# Authentication

> To obtain an authentication token:

```php
$data = json_encode(
    array(
        "email" => "you@youremail.com",
        "password" => "password"
    )
);

$ch = curl_init('https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/token');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "POST");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    'Accept: application/json',
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Content-Length: ' . strlen($data))
);

$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $result;
```

```javascript
// make sure you have installed the request module (npm install request)
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  url: 'https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/token',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  },
  form: {
      email: 'you@youremail.com',
      password: 'password'
  }
};

request.post(options, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('Request Failed:', err);
  }
  console.log(body);
});
```
> The above code returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
   "success":true,
   "data":{
      "token":"asd1AdiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.dafMTasdsa..."
   }
}
```

All requests to Shiptheory must contain an authentication bearer token. Use your regular [Shiptheory account](https://shiptheory.com/login) username and password to request a token.

The authentication bearer token must be included in the header of all subsequent requests as per below.

`Authorization: Bearer asd1AdiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.dafMTasdsa..`

To request an authentication bearer token, make a POST request, providing your Shiptheory email and password.

Make sure that the authentication request (and all subsequent requests) provide `application/json` under the `Accept` and `Content-Type` Headers.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/token`

### Parameters

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | -------  | -----------
email     | Yes      | The email address you use to login to Shiptheory
password  | Yes      | The password you use to login to Shiptheory

<aside class="notice">
Authentication tokens <code>expire after 60 minutes</code>.

# Return Labels

Currently, limited carriers support Returns within Shiptheory.

See our list of <a href="http://support.shiptheory.com/support/solutions/articles/24000045115" target="_blank">Supported Returns Carriers</a> for more information.

## Automatic Shipping Rules

If you would like to generate Returns Labels automatically to put into your outgoing parcels, you can add return services to your shipping rules.

![alt text](/images/rules_return_example.png)

Once you have set this, not passing the `delivery_service` parameter when making a `book` request and subsequent requests to `Get Details` will include the Returns Labels specified in your shipping rule within the PDF `label` binary string.

## Creating a Return Label

This method allows you to create a return label from an existing shipment. All of the address, order and product data will be taken automatically from the existing shipment.

To make this call, you need to know the `Reference` and outgoing `Postcode` on the original shipment.

A label and return tracking number will be returned, or an error message. While messages and errors are stored in the shipment history, the label will not be stored against the shipment, so you should save the label returned from the API. Subsequent calls to create a return label will produce a new label.

Please note: Any other data sent with this request will be ignored. If you need to change shipment data on the return label, you should create a Headless Return label.

```php
$data = json_encode(
    array(
        "outgoing_reference" => "S0001001",
        "delivery_postcode" => "BS1 4TW",
        "return_service" => 200,
        "expiry" => "2019-10-23"
    )
);

$ch = curl_init('https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/returns');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "POST");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false);

    'Authorization: Bearer AasLK190ALhaLDSj1nal92Ja...',
    'Content-Length: ' . strlen($data))
);

$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $result;

```

    }
};

request.post(options, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('Request Failed:', err);
  }
  console.log(body);
});
```

> A successful request will return JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "tracking": "ST123456789X",
  "label": "JVBERi0xLjQKMyAwIG9iago8PC9UeXBlIC9QYWdlCi9QYXJlbnQgMSAwIFIKL01lZG5ID..."
}
```

> An unsuccessful request will return JSON structured like this:

```json
{
   "error": {
      "expiry": {
         "expiry_length": "Your returns label expiry is not allowed. The label must expire within 30 days"
         }
      }
}
```

> Or

```
{
   "error": "Unable to find a shipment with the reference 'ST0000040' and postcode 'bs1 x2w'"
}
```

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/returns`

### Parameters

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
outgoing_reference | Yes | The unique reference on the shipment. See <a href="#book">Book Shipment</a>.
delivery_postcode | Yes | A original outgoing postcode/zip code on the shipment
return_service | Yes | The return service `id`. See <a href="#incoming-services-returns-">GET Incoming Services</a>.
expiry | Yes | YYYY-MM-DD. The date the returns label expires and can no longer be used. Maximum 30 days into the future.

## Headless Returns

If you would like to create returns labels that are not attached to any existing shipment in Shiptheory, please contact support.


# Delivery Services

## Outgoing Services

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/services');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    'Authorization: bearer asd1AdiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.dafMTasdsa..',
    'Accept: application/json'
));

$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $result;
```

```javascript
// make sure you have installed the request module (npm install request)
var request = require('request');

request.get('https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/services', {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  },
  auth: {
    'bearer': 'eyJ0eXAiO....'
  }
}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('Request Failed:', err);
  }
  console.log(body);
});
```

> The above code returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "delivery_services": {
    "DPD": {
      "Parcel - Homecall": {
        "id": "37",
        "courier_increment_ids": [
          "1"
        ]
      },
      "Parcel - Two Day": {
        "id": "38",
        "courier_increment_ids": [
          "1",
          "2"
        ]
      },
      "Parcel - Next Day": {
        "id": "39",
        "courier_increment_ids": [
          "2"
        ]
      }
     }
   }
}
```


Performing a GET on `/services` returns a list of outgoing delivery services available on your Shiptheory account.

When booking a shipment, if you pass a ``delivery_service`` your shipment will skip shipping rules and book the shipment with the carrier that owns the specified delivery service.

The ``delivery_service`` field relates directly to the ``id`` of the Delivery Service in Shiptheory. You can get a list of the Delivery Services available to your Shiptheory account by calling the Services API endpoint.

The response will also list which courier increments a delivery service is available for, by returning an array of IDs in the ``courier_increment_ids`` field.

Performing a GET on `/services/incoming` returns a list of incoming (return) delivery services available on your Shiptheory account.

The format of incoming services looks a little different to that of outgoing services.

The `id` field is what you need to pass in the `return_service` field when making Return Label POST request.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/services/incoming`

# Packages

Some carriers, typically pallet, freight and international carriers, support specifying multiple differing package sizes when creating a shipment. For those carriers that support it, it is possible to specify the package size in the [`Book Shipment` POST request](https://shiptheory.com/developer/index.html#book).

## Sizes

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/packages/sizes');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    'Authorization: bearer asd1AdiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.dafMTasdsa..',
    'Accept: application/json'
));

$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $result;
```

```javascript
// make sure you have installed the request module (npm install request)
var request = require('request');

request.get('https://api.shiptheory.com/v1/packages/sizes', {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  },
  auth: {
    'bearer': 'eyJ0eXAiO....'
  }
}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('Request Failed:', err);
  }
  console.log(body);
});
```

> The above code returns JSON structured like this:

```json

When adding a shipment via the `Book Shipment` POST request [documented above](https://shiptheory.com/developer/index.html#book), any product data that is different (except the SKU), will be updated in your catalogue. The same happens if you download orders from a third party sales channel, such as Magento, or BigCommerce; when product data is seen by Shiptheory that differs from what is on file, the latest data is used, overwriting existing data.
